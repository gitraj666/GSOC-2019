# Core Model Migration to TensorFlow 2.0
* **Student**: Prithviraj Maurya[mouryaprithviraj@gmail.com]

## Description:

The official models are a collection of classic research models that use TensorFlowâ€™s high-level APIs. The models represent a wide array of machine learning applications, from image classification to reinforcement learning, and they are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up-to-date with the latest stable TensorFlow API. They should be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read.


## Deliverables:
  -       For this project, I would be responsible for updating all official models in the tensorflow/models repo to TF 2.0 compatibility, and ensuring that they natively use the recommended TensorFlow APIs such as Keras and DistributionStrategies


## Timeline:
- May 6 - 27, 2019 ( Community bonding) - I will study the github repo of tensorflow and its models, also discussing with mentors.
- May 27, 2019 - August 19, 2019 - I will start finding out the models which need to be modified for tensorflow 2.0 and also figuring out the specific area of code which needs to be modified and also optimize those.
August 16, 2016 - final evaluation.
- I can work 6 hours a day, 6 days a week during the community bonding period. During the coding period, I can assure you 36 hours a week up until 28th July after which I can give 32 hours a week until the final submission deadline. 

## About Me:
I am a Final Year Graduate from Mumbai University pursuing my Bachelor's. Very passionate about AI and ML i find tensorflow a great boon for developers like me helping us under the hood to create great Applications. One of the interesting Project i would like to talk about is ChildGrowthMonitor(https://childgrowthmonitor.org) which i am a recently a part of. It is an app that measure the height and arms length of baby to predict the weight and other nutritional information about the baby and help doctors monitor its growth. We analyze 3D point clouds of the baby scan images to find various measurements as much as we can. This type of project excite me the most as it impacts the society directly and this is my small contribution for making the lives of unprivileged children in India and other parts of the world a little better.
